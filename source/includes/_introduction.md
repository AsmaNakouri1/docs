# Introduction

Welcome to the Diduenjoy API official documentation!

The Diduenjoy API is organized around REST and JSON API. Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients, and we support cross-origin resource sharing to allow you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application (though you should remember that you should never expose your secret API key in any public website's client-side code). JSON will be returned in all responses from the API, including errors.

You can view code examples and snippets in different programming language in the right frame and switch between them with the top right tabs.

This API documentation was created by [Diduenjoy](https://github.com/diduenjoy). Feel free to submit us some improvements such as new suported languages or corrections.
